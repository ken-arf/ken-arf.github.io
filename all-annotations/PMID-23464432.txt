Association between the hsa-mir-27a variant and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis.

Although a number of studies were published in the past several years on associations between hsa-mir-27a and cancer risk, the findings remain conflicting rather than conclusive. To derive a more precise effect on the association between SNP hsa-mir-27a rs895819 and breast cancer risk, we conducted a meta-analysis for the first time. Through retrieval from PubMed for the period up to August 2012, a total of four studies were identified with 3,287 cases and 4,298 controls for SNP hsa-mir-27a rs895819.We calculated summary odds ratio (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed effects model (when the heterogeneity was absent, P>0.10). Otherwise, the random-effects model was used. We found that hsa-mir-27a rs895819 polymorphism also did not reveal any relationship with breast cancer susceptibility (AG versus AA: OR = 0.98; 95%CI, 0.73-1.32; GG versus AA: OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72-1.03; AG/GG versus AA: OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74-1.14), while significantly decreased risk was found among Europeans in AG versus AA and AG/GG versus AA models tested (AG versus AA: OR = 0.83; 95%CI, 0.72-0.97; GG versus AA: OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.71-1.05; AG/GG versus AA: OR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.94). These findings suggest that hsa-mir-27a rs895819 polymorphism may play an important role in breast cancer development.
