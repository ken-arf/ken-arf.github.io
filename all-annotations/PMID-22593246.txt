A genetic variant located in miR-423 is associated with reduced breast cancer risk.

Since microRNAs (miRNAs) act as translational regulators of multiple genes, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in them can have potentially wide-ranging effects. Using an association approach, this research examined the effects of the rs6505162 SNP, an A > C polymorphism located in the pre-miRNA region of miR-423, on breast cancer development. Caucasian Australian women with breast cancer and controls matched for age and ethnicity were genotyped for rs6505162 and their genotypic and allelic frequencies analysed for significant differences. Analysis indicated that there were significant differences between the case and control populations (Ï‡2 = 6.70, p = 0.035), with the CC genotype conferring reduced risk of breast cancer development (odds ratio = 0.50 95% confidence interval = 0.27-0.92, p = 0.03). Further functional research is required to determine the mechanism of action of this SNP on miRNA function.
