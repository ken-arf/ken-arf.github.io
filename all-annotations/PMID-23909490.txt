Polymorphisms in the ERCC1 and XPF genes and risk of breast cancer in a Chinese population.

Inherited functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes may influence the capability of DNA repair and contribute to the risk of breast cancer. We therefore performed a case-control study to investigate the association of three in excision repair cross-complimentary group 1 (ERCC1) and three in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XPF) with the risk of breast cancer. Genotyping of ERCC1 (rs2298881, rs3212986, and rs11615) and XPF (rs2276465, rs6498486, and rs2276466) was performed in a 384-well plate format on the MassARRAY(Â®) platform. Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the effect of each SNP on breast cancer risk. The ERCC1 rs11615 variant A/A genotype was associated with increased breast cancer risk in codominant, dominant, and recessive models, and XPF rs6498486 variant C/C genotype carriers have a significantly increased breast cancer risk in codominant, dominant, and recessive models. Individuals with both the ERCC1 rs11615 A allele and XPF rs6498486 C allele had a heavy increased risk of breast cancer compared to double wild-type homozygotes. The present study shows that the ERCC1 rs11615 and XPF rs6498486 polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer risk in a Chinese population. Further large-scale studies are required to elucidate whether these ERCC1 and XPF SNPs interact with environmental factors in the development of breast cancer.
