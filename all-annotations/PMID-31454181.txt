TERT rs10069690 polymorphism and cancers risk: A meta-analysis.
Studies have identified that the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene polymorphism rs10069690 (C>T) is associated with cancer risk, but the results remain inconclusive. To provide a more precise estimation of the relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of 45 published studies including 329,035 cases and 730,940 controls. We conducted a search in PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science to select studies on the association between rs10069690 and cancer risk. Stratification by ethnicity, cancer type, cancers' classification, source of control, sample size, and genotype method was used to explore the source of heterogeneity. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random effects models. Sensitivity, publication bias, false-positive report probability (FPRP) and statistical power were also assessed. The result demonstrated that rs10069690 was significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer overall (OR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12, p < .001) under the allele model. Stratification analysis revealed an increased cancer risk in subgroups of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, a significantly decreased association was observed in pancreatic cancer in the European population (OR = 0.93,95% CI: 0.87-0.99, p = .031). In the subgroup analysis based on cancer type, no significant association was found in prostate cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer and glioma. This meta-analysis suggested that the TERT rs10069690 polymorphism may be a risk factor for cancer, especially breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and RCC. Further functional studies are warranted to reveal the role of the polymorphism in carcinogenesis.
