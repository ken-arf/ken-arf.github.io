Single nucleotide polymorphism in hsa-mir-196a-2 and breast cancer risk: a case control study.

microRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that influence gene expression on a post-transcriptional level. They participate in diverse biological pathways and may act as either tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. As they may have an effect on thousands of target mRNAs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNA genes might have major functional consequences, because the microRNA's properties and/or maturation may change. miR-196a has been reported to be aberrantly expressed in breast cancer tissue. Additionally, the SNP rs11614913 in hsa-mir-196a-2 has been found to be associated with breast cancer risk in some studies although not in others. This study evaluated the association between rs11614913 and breast cancer risk in a Caucasian case-control cohort in Queensland, Australia. Results do not support an association of the tested hsa-mir-196a-2 polymorphism with breast cancer susceptibility in this cohort. As there is a discrepancy between our results and previous findings, it is important to assess the role of rs11614913 in breast cancer by further larger studies investigating different ethnic groups.
