Genetic variants at 5p12 and risk of breast cancer in Han Chinese.
A genome-wide association study, conducted among women of European ancestry, has identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs4415084 (T>C) and rs10941679 (A>G) at chromosome 5p12 were associated with risk of breast cancer, suggesting that genetic variants in this region may have a role in the development of breast cancer. To investigate the associations between SNPs at 5p12 and risk of breast cancer in the Chinese population, we conducted a fine-mapping in 5p12 using a haplotype-tagging SNP approach and genotyped these SNPs with a case-control study consisting of 878 cases and 900 controls. We found that the two risk SNPs reported in the European population were neither associated with breast cancer risk in our Chinese population, nor did the fine-mapping SNPs after controlling multiple comparison.
