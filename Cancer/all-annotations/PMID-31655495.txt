Association of polymorphisms in LOC105377871 and CASC16 with breast cancer in the northwest Chinese Han population.
Breast cancer represents the cancer with the highest incidence and mortality among women in the world, and its pathogenesis is complex. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are one of the factors that influence the risk of breast cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of LOC105377871 and CASC16 polymorphisms on the risk of breast cancer in the northwest Chinese Han population. We selected 503 breast cancer patients and 503 healthy controls for the present study. Genotyping was performed using the Agena MassARRAY system (Agenea Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and we evaluated the association between SNPs (rs17530068 and rs4784227) and the risk of breast cancer in four genetic models. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). It was found that the rs17530068 increased the breast cancer risk in log-additive model (p = 0.047, OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.00-1.50). After stratification, the "T" allele of rs4784227 increased the risk of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients (allele: p = 0.025, OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.05-2.17; codominant model: p = 0.008, OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.20-3.31; dominant model: p = 0.008, OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.19-3.16; log-additive model: p = 0.023, OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.06-2.19). The results of the present study show that, in the northwest Chinese Han population, SNP rs17530068 (LOC105377871) increases the risk of breast cancer and SNP rs4784227 (CASC16) promotes lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients.
