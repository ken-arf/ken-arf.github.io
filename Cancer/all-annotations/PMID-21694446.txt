Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene with adiponectin levels and cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients with cancer.

The aims of this study are to (1) study the influence of polymorphisms in adiponectin gene on adiponectin levels and potential associations with breast, prostate and colon cancer; (2) investigate the associations of adiponectin levels with other adipokines and breast, prostate and colon cancers. We measured fasting adiponectin, leptin, insulin, Sex steroids in 132 (66 females, 66 males) cancer patients and 68 age and sex matched apparently healthy subjects. Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference were used as indices of obesity. Insulin Resistance was assessed using Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP rs182052 (G-10066-A), SNP rs1501299 (276G > T), SNP rs224176 (45T > G) in adiponectin gene were studied using Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction. GG genotype of SNP rs1501299 was significantly associated with higher levels of adiponectin (OR=1.2, 95%CI(1.03-1.3), p = 0.02); breast (OR=8.6, 95%CI(1.03-71), p = 0.04), colon cancers (OR= 12, 95%CI(1.2-115), p =0.03). GT genotype was also associated significantly with colon cancer (OR=2.6, 95%CI (1.1-6), p =0.03). However SNP rs224176 was associated with only breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that adiponectin gene SNP rs1501299 and SNP rs224176 may be the predisposing factors in some cancers but our results differ from what has been reported in other populations suggesting a complex relationship between genetic variations and phenotypic adiponectin levels.
