The earwax-associated SNP c.538G>A (G180R) in ABCC11 is not associated with breast cancer risk in Europeans.

Genetic polymorphisms of human ABC-transporter genes have been suggested to modulate breast cancer risk in the general population. In particular ABCC11 (MRP8), which is highly expressed in breast cancer tissue and involved in the efflux of conjugated estrogen metabolites such as estrone-3-sulfate and estradiol-17beta-glucuronide, has recently been proposed as a potential risk factor for female breast cancer. The wet earwax-associated G-allele of the c.538G>A polymorphism was associated with an increased risk for breast cancer in Japanese women. In contrast, no evidence for such an association could be observed in Caucasian women. We aimed to confirm/refute the association of the c.538G>A variant in ABCC11 with breast cancer risk and/or histo-pathological tumor characteristics in an independent population-based breast cancer case-control study from Germany comprising 1021 cases and 1015 age-matched controls. No association for allele and genotype frequencies of the 538G>A variant in ABCB11 with breast cancer risk was found. Our data suggest that the c.538G>A variation in ABCC11 does not contribute to breast carcinogenesis in women of European descent.
