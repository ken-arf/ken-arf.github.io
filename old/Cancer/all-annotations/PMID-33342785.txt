Breast cancer-related single-nucleotide polymorphism and their risk contribution in Mexican women. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Mexican patients and their association with the development of breast cancer (BC). This work is focused on determining the association of fibroblast growth factor receptor (rs12196489), TOX3 (rs3803662), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (h TERT, rs10069690), and FTO (rs17817449) polymorphisms and BC in a cohort of Mexican women. The study included 56 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of BC and 83 controls. Clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records. Genomic DNA from the samples was obtained from lymphocytes, and the genotyping of rs12196489, rs3803662, rs10069690, and rs17817449 polymorphisms was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using specific TaqMan probes. Statistical analysis was assessed to evaluate the distribution of genotype frequencies between cases and controls. We used the STATA Statistical Package (version 10.1; STATA Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Student's t-test, χ No statistical differences in allelic and genotypic frequencies were found between patients with BC and controls for SNPs: rs1219648, rs3803662, and rs17817449. Interestingly, according to the χ The h TERT (rs10069690) polymorphism might be associated with BC in Mexican women. Nevertheless, additional studies in a larger cohort are required to confirm this association and to possibly use this polymorphism as a potential biomarker in the early diagnosis of BC.
