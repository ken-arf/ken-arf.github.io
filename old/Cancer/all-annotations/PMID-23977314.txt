Association between 1p11-rs11249433 polymorphism and breast cancer susceptibility: evidence from 15 case-control studies. Genome-wide association studies have identified SNP rs11249433 at chromosome 1p11 as a new breast cancer (BC) susceptibility locus in populations of European descent. Since then, the relationship between 1p11- rs11249433 and breast cancer has been reported in various ethnic groups; however, these studies have yielded inconsistent results. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of 15 studies involving a total of 90,154 cases and 137,238 controls for 1p11-rs11249433 polymorphism to evaluate its effect on genetic susceptibility for breast cancer. An overall random effects odds ratio of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06-1.12, P<10(-5)) was found for rs11249433-G variant. Significant results were also observed for heterozygous (OR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.12, P<10(-5)) and homozygote (OR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21, P<10(-5)). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity, which largely disappeared after stratification by ethnicity. After stratiﬁed by ethnicity, significant associations were found among Caucasians. However, no significant associations were detected among East Asian and African populations. In addition, we found that rs11249433 polymorphism on 1p11 confer risk, exclusively for ER-positive tumors with per-allele OR of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.08-1.18; P <10(-5)) compared to ER-negative tumors of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.98-1.04; P=0.49). Similar results were also observed when stratified by PR status. Our findings demonstrated that rs11249433-G allele is a risk-conferring factor for the development of breast cancer, especially in Caucasians.
