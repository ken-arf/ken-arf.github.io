NOTCH Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the Predisposition of Breast and Colorectal Cancers in Saudi Patients. Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease and is one of the most common malignancy affecting women worldwide while colorectal cancer (CRC) is estimated to be the third common cancer and second leading cause of cancer related death globally. Both BC and CRC involve multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations in genes belonging to various signaling pathways including NOTCH that has been implicated in the development of these cancers. We investigated four single nucleotide polymorphisms, each in genes encoding NOTCH1-4 receptors for their role in susceptibility to breast and colorectal cancers in Saudi population. In this case-control study, TaqMan genotypic analysis of rs3124591 in NOTCH1 and rs3820041 in NOTCH4 did not exhibit association with breast as well as colorectal cancers. However, a strong association of rs11249433 which is in close proximity to NOTCH2 was observed with breast cancer susceptibility especially with those having an early onset of the disease. Interestingly, the rs1043994 located in NOTCH3 showed gender preference and was found to be significantly associated with colorectal cancers in males. Validation of these findings in bigger populations of different ethnicities may prove beneficial in identifying rs11249433 and rs1043994 as genetic screening markers for early detection of breast and colorectal carcinomas, respectively.
