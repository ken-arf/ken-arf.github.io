Polymorphisms in lncRNA HOTAIR and susceptibility to breast cancer in a Chinese population.

Controversial data have emerged on the association between cancer risk and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs920778C>T) in Hox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR). No data on the association between HOTAIR polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) susceptibility and reproductive factors have been reported in China. In this study we investigated the association between HOTAIR polymorphisms and BC susceptibility in a population-based case-control study of 502 cases and 504 matched controls in China. Three haplotype tagging SNPs (rs1899663, rs4759314, rs920778) of HOTAIR were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and created-restriction-site PCR (CRS-RFLP) assays. False-positive report probability (FPRP) was calculated to test for false-positive associations. Interactions between the SNPs and reproductive factors were further evaluated by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. BC risk reduction was confined to subgroups of age at menarche >14 (OR: 0.42, 95%CI: 0.21, 0.82) and number of pregnancies >2 (OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.49, 0.95) for GT+TT rs1899663, and age at menopause â‰¤ 50 (OR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.84, 0.99) for AG+GG rs4759314. Subjects with Trs920778 had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.13, 1.75). We observed a significant interaction between rs920778 and reproductive factors, including age at menopause, number of abortions, and family history. Our results were unlikely to be false positives according to FPRP calculation. In conclusion, genetic variant rs920778 in HOTAIR significantly increased the risk of BC, and it may have apparent interaction with reproductive factors in the progression on BC. These findings extend available data on the association between HOTAIR polymorphisms and BC susceptibility.
