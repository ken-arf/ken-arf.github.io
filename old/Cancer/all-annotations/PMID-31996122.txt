The association of CASC16 variants with breast Cancer risk in a northwest Chinese female population.
Genetic variants play a critical role in the development of breast cancer. This investigation aimed to explore the association between CASC16 polymorphisms and breast cancer susceptibility. We conducted a case-control study of 681 patients and 680 healthy individuals to investigate the correlation of five SNPs with breast cancer in a Northwest Chinese female population. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the association. Our study found that rs4784227 and rs12922061 were significantly related to an increased susceptibility to breast cancer (OR 1.22, p = 0.022; OR 1.21, p = 0.026). While rs3803662 was a protective role in breast cancer risk (OR 0.69, p = 0.042). Stratified analyses indicated that rs4784227 and rs12922061 would increase breast cancer susceptibility at age >  50 years. Rs3803662 was a reduced factor of breast cancer risk by age ≤ 50 years. Rs4784227 was significantly increased risk of breast cancer in stage III/IV. The rs45544231 and rs3112612 had a protective effect on breast cancer with tumor size > 2 cm. Rs4784227 and rs12922061 could enhance breast cancer risk in lymph node metastasis positive individuals. CASC16 rs12922061 and rs4784227 polymorphisms correlated with an increased risk of breast cancer in BMI >  24 kg/m2. Haplotype analyses revealed that Grs45544231 Trs12922061 Ars3112612 and Grs45544231 Crs12922061 Ars3112612 haplotypes decreased breast cancer risk. Our study revealed that CASC16 genetic variants were significantly related to breast cancer susceptibility, which might give scientific evidence for exploring the molecular mechanism of breast cancer.
