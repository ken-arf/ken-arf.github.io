Assessing interactions between the association of common genetic variant at 1p11 (rs11249433) and hormone receptor status with breast cancer risk.
The association between rs11249433 polymorphism on 1p11 and breast cancer (BC) has been widely evaluated since it was first identified through genome-wide association approach. However, the results have been inconclusive. To investigate this inconsistency, we performed a meta-analysis of all available studies dealing with the relationship between the 1p11-rs11249433 polymorphism and BC. Databases including Pubmed, SCOPUS, ISI web of knowledge, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched to find relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. The random-effects model was applied, addressing heterogeneity and publication bias. A total of 15 articles involving 90,291 cases and 137,525 controls were included. In a combined analysis, the summary per-allele odds ratio (OR) for BC of 1p11-rs11249433 polymorphism was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06-1.12; P<10(-5)). Significant associations were also observed under dominant and recessive genetic models. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significantly increased risks were found in Caucasians; whereas no significant associations were found among Asians and Africans. In addition, our data indicate that 1p11-rs11249433 polymorphism is involved in BC susceptibility and confer its effect primarily in estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive tumors. In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrated that the G allele of 1p11-rs11249433 is a risk factor associated with increased breast cancer susceptibility, but these associations vary in different ethnic populations.
